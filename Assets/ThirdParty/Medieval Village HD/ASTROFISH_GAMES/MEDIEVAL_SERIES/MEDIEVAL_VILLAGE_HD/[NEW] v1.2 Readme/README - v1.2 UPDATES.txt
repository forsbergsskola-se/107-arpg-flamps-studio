NEW - Building Interiors.

v1.2 UPDATES:

Hey guys, thanks for purchasing the DETAILED - Medieval Village.
As some of you may know, the pack didn't originally ship with interior room prefabs.
The pack has been updated to include 8 buildings with interiors and exteriors.
There are also many floor prefabs such as Ground, Middle and Roof sections.

There is a Ladder prefab in some of these buildings which is currently missing it's prefab, however - this will get replaced
in the next few weeks.

Planned for v1.3:

The demo scene for the interior/exterior buildings, which you can see in the POLY STYLE - Medieval Village needs to be included in this pack.
More work needs to be done on the terrain, lighting and QA before it is added so this will happen some time in the coming weeks.

Get in touch if you would like an early copy of the the demo scene as a .package

As always, you can hop over to our Discord and have a chat with me if you'd like. Here's the invite link: https://discord.gg/MUEcKKM

Thanks!
